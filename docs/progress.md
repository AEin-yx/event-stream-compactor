## Day 1: Core Logging Tools
### Technical Achievements
- Implemented Typer-based CLI framework
- Created three specialized logging commands
- Established consistent error handling pattern

### System Design Decisions
- Chose Typer for CLI: Modern Python framework with strong type support
- Selected deque for logtail: Memory-efficient circular buffer
- Implemented UTF-8 with error replacement: Robust character handling

### Performance Considerations
- Memory usage optimization in logtail
- File reading efficiency tradeoffs
- Regex pattern matching performance

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of memory vs speed tradeoffs
- Experience with file encoding challenges
- Insight into statistics validation

### Future Enhancements
- Add streaming support for large files
- Implement configurable encodings
- Develop comprehensive test suite
