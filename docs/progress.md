## Day 1 Task 1: Core Logging Tools
### Technical Achievements
- Implemented Typer-based CLI framework
- Created three specialized logging commands
- Established consistent error handling pattern

### System Design Decisions
- Chose Typer for CLI: Modern Python framework with strong type support
- Selected deque for logtail: Memory-efficient circular buffer
- Implemented UTF-8 with error replacement: Robust character handling

### Performance Considerations
- Memory usage optimization in logtail
- File reading efficiency tradeoffs
- Regex pattern matching performance

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of memory vs speed tradeoffs
- Experience with file encoding challenges
- Insight into statistics validation

### Future Enhancements
- Add streaming support for large files
- Implement configurable encodings
- Develop comprehensive test suite

## Day 5-8 Task 2: Log Parser Engine
### Technical Achievements
- Implemented regex-based HDFS log parser with ISO-8601 timestamp conversion
- Developed statistical analysis module (events/sec, log level distribution)
- Created structured JSON output for downstream compaction
- Built fault-tolerant parsing (invalid timestamp handling)

### System Design Decisions
- **Chose regex over NLP**: Chose regex for pattern matching: Flexible and efficient
- **ISO timestamps**: Prioritized sortable format for time-based compaction
- Added statistics calculation: Provides log distribution insights
- **Dynamic field handling**: Preserved raw message while extracting components

### Performance Considerations
- File reading efficiency
- Memory usage optimization
- Timestamp processing overhead
- Statistics calculation impact

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of log format parsing
- Experience with timestamp handling
- Statistical patterns in operational logs (96% INFO = low compaction priority)
- Knowledge of error handling patterns

### Future Enhancements
- Add streaming support
- Implement configurable formats
- Develop comprehensive testing
- Add filtering capabilities
- Sampling mode for billion-scale logs
